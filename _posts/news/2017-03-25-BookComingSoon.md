My new book "Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming", collaborated with my former PhD Thesis advisor, is coming soon.

The book is based on my PhD thesis and is a small step towards integrating reinforcement learning into adaptive/optimal/robust nonlinear control system design. As supplementary materials, a number of examples created in MATLAB and Simulink are being maintained by myself and are available to download for free. Hopefully, it can be a good reference for researchers and engineers working in related areas.

Find it on
[Amazon] (https://www.amazon.com/Adaptive-Dynamic-Programming-Systems-Engineering/dp/1119132649) and elsewhere.
