== A Short Biography

Born in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an Xi'an], China, I obtained the B.Sc. degree in Applied Mathematics from [http://www.sysu.edu.cn Sun Yat-sen University], Guangzhou, China, in 2006, the M.Sc. degree in automation science and engineering from [http://www.scut.edu.cn South China University of Technology], Guangzhou, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from [http://www.nyu.edu New York University], Brooklyn, NY, in 2014. I interned at [http://www.merl.com Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL)], Cambridge, MA, in summer 2013. My PhD dissertation topic is the theory of robust adaptive dynamic programming (RADP) and its applications. \n
\n
I joined the Engineering Development Group at [http://www.mathworks.com  The Mathworks] as an Application Support Engineering in June 2014. I am still actively conducting research in my spare time. In particular, I am interested in developing adaptive-dynamic-programming-based methods for robust optimal nonlinear system design, and applying them to engineering and reverse-engineering systems. Also, I have been volunteering as anonymous reviewers for journals and conferences on Control and Systems Engineering. \n
\n
I am the recipient of the Richard Rosenthal Award, for the outstanding performance on the electrical engineering PhD Qualifying Examination at NYU, in 2010, and the [http://acassoc.org/pera/super_pages.php?ID=pera2 Shimemura Young Author Prize] (with Prof. Zhong-Ping Jiang) at the 9th Asian Control Conference, Istanbul, Turkey, 2013. \n
